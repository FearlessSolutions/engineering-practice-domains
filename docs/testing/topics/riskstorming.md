# Riskstorming Concepts & Practices

Riskstorming is an activity done to help identify quality criteria, risks and mitigation strategies around an area of focus for a team.  This can include a specific function or feature, a component of a system, a subset of parts of a system or a system/application as a whole.  

## Collaborative risk assessment

Working with others is a major part of good testing.  When we can collaborate together to identify quality criteria and risks, we take advantage of many perspectives that the team has.  More perspectives means that we can have a broader scope for which we can use to identify risks to our focus.

## Shared understanding

Being able to work together also gives us the capability of sharing understanding of how we each think.  This helps to broaden our own perspectives and builds a stronger unity on the team in the form of shared understanding of the perspectives of the people we work and collaborate day to day.

## Proactive testing

Riskstorming is often a proactive measure to helping prevent risks from coming to light.  Thinking about possible risks that might happen in the future allows us to build around those possible problems and hopefully prevent them from ever happening.  The costs of preventing a risk often outweigh the costs of seeing a risk come to light and cleaning up after the mess they leave behind.
