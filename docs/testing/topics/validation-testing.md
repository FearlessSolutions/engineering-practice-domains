# Validation Testing Concepts and Practices

Validation testing is a broad topic that can mean different things depending on the context.  Generally, the idea is that validation is a part of the software development process to ensure that the software being built meets defined specifications and requirements.  This is distinctly different from User Testing or User Acceptance Testing in that the specifications are what is being tested against rather than user feedback/impressions.   User feedback is important, but this is a different kind of testing to make sure concrete requirements and specifications are met.

## Validation through collaboration - shared understanding

Frequent collaboration throughout the development process to help ensure there is a shared understanding of the plan for how a product will be built.  The shared understanding of the plan and the specifications/requirements helps to ensure that validation happens throughout the development process rather than just at the end.
