# 508 & Accessibility Testing

# 508 Compliance Testing Concepts & Practices

## 508 compliance and the law

Fearless takes accessibility very seriously.   While we understand that accessibility as part of 508 compliance is a legal requirement, this is an embedded part of our design practices, development practices and testing practices because it is the right thing to do to make sure we build software for everyone.  From a testing perspective, this means that we help to advocate for accessibility as part of design, so that we address accessibility concerns proactively and then work to ensure those accessibility concerns are addressed throughout the software development lifecycle.

## WCAG Standards and POUR Principles

Fearless leans on common accessibility principles outlined by the W3C to help us in making sure that software we create is meeting the needs of all users.   We lean on the WCAG recommendations outlined by the WC3 and required by Section 508 to ensure we meet and exceed the standards there.  We also take to heart the POUR principle that is the guiding light for WCAG, ensuring that applications we build are Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust.

## Accessibility Testing Tools

Tools aid us in helping to make sure software we create is accessible, but we understand that tools only represent a small slice of what can be used to test and validate accessibility.  Tools have limitations and we never rely on tools alone to paint the whole picture.  They help us to determine the things that are hard for a human to figure out, like helping to make sure that all images have alt text.  However, tools cannot determine if that alt text is correct or appropriate, and this is where the human element must pick up the slack to ensure we are doing the right things.

These are some of the tools we utilize to aid us in our testing:

* JAWS
* JAWS Inspect
* NVDA
* Chrome Dev Tools - Lighthouse
* aXe DevTools
* axe-core
