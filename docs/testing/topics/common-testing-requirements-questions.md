# Common Testing Requirements & Questions

# Common Requirements

The following are common requirements seen in solicitation orders, statements of objectives, statements of work.  These requirements vary from contract to contract, agency to agency depending on context, but these general principles can be applied to how we tackle them and how we talk about them.

## Test Driven Development

Typically looking for experience in creating automated unit and/or integration tests during development rather than later in the development cycle.  This can be a strict or loose implementation, depending on the project/requirements.

## Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)

The QASP is a Government developed and applied document used to make sure the systematic quality assurance methods are used in the administration of the Performance Based Service Contract (PBSC) standards.  This document helps to set a framework around other requirements for testing.

## Security Scanning, Testing, Assessment and Remediation

Security requirements can involve a very broad range of needs.  Often this is looking for some kind of independent security assessment that delivers some type of report for evaluation of the security of the system.  This can include the use of 3rd party assessors, tools, scanners and manual processes to assess security requirements.

## Code Coverage

Code Coverage requirements can be a tricky thing to tackle on projects because of the perception of what they mean and how they can be measured.  Ideally, this is an INTERNAL metric teams use to help drive better testing, but not as a strict requirement for success.  We should always push back on requirements for code coverage as a measure of success and frame code coverage in terms of a tool used to help us test better and reduce risk.

## Code Style and Standards

This is typically a standard to help improve how code looks and is styled so there is a consistent feel to code across a project.  Normally this is handled by static analysis tools and decided by the team.

## Code Quality

Similar to Code Style and Standards, this is another approach to ensure that the code being written follows common good practices.  Also handled by static analysis tools, implementing the tools helps to warn developers of potential problems in the code being written (specific to the language being written in) and can sometimes automatically fix problems when implemented in certain ways.

## Team Delivery Performance

This aspect often focuses on how the team is delivering, typically looking at metrics like cycle time, committed tasks compared to completed tasks, and frequency of commits, deployments, etc.

## Accessibility

Accessibility is often a focus on the adherence and compliance with 508 and WCAG standards for a project.  This covers the manual assessment of standards in addition to the tools used for automatic assessment and reporting for ensuring compliance.

## QA & Software Testing

This is the general practice of software testing by test engineers/QA's that usually covers manual testing, test planning, test strategies and execution of tests.   This can also include the planning of automation and the general quality strategy overall, typically with respect to a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan.

## Documentation

Documentation can take many forms for testing, but normally this will involve the documentation of test strategies, test cases, test results and test reports.  We avoid trying to spend time on needless documentation as this often takes away valuable time for testing, but the goal is to meet important needs when we can.

## A/B testing with end users

A/B testing is usually a design process, particularly with respect to testing with end users, but absolutely plays a role in testing and quality overall.  Conducting this kind of testing provides information on decisions to make for changes in the application to improve the quality for users.
