# Ensemble Guide
## What is Ensemble?
Ensemble is a modernized, structured technique for large group pair programming or testing.  This technique is also sometimes called Mob Programming.
## Why Ensemble?
Ensemble is a slightly newer take on traditional mob programming.  With a name that embraces a more welcoming atmosphere, there is also a specific focus on collaborative learning and togetherness.  While things will get done, the real benefit is how we learn from each other and build bonds through learning.
## How is it done?
A single screen, keyboard and mouse are shared by all participants to do a programming or testing task.  A timer is used to timebox a turn.  When a turn is complete, the current Navigator becomes the next Driver and someone from the audience becomes the next Navigator.  A list can be used to maintain an order of participants to cycle through.
### Navigator Roles
	A Navigator comes up with ideas and conveys instructions and directions to the driver.  This is usually the active speaker.  Navigators will ask  questions when they are uncertain of what to do next.
### Driver Role
	Listens to the navigator and has control of the keyboard/mouse. Drivers try to do what the Navigator is directing them to do.  Drivers ask questions if the instructions are unclear.
### Audience
	Observes the action and provides feedback when requested.
## Guidelines
These guidelines help to make sure we follow good practices when working together.

* Yes, andâ€¦ 
* No decisions on the keyboard.
* Communicate in the highest level of abstraction.
