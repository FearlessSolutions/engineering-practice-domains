# Ensemble Programming / Testing

# Ensemble Concepts & Practices

Very similar to Pair Programming and Mob Programming, Ensemble is a framework for having a large group collaborate around a testing or programming task in order to learn, collaborate and build bonds during the process.  Ensemble is a techniques that creates a safe space for people of different skill and knowledge levels to work through challenges and demonstrate techniques to overcome challenges.

## Collaborative Learning

Ensemble focuses on collaborative learning so we can see how others learn and also offer opportunities for others to learn the things we are learning as well.  While this typically focuses on a programming or testing task, it is less about getting the task done and learning how others do the task itself.  Driver and navigator positions put people in the seat of giving instructions and taking instructions, separating the listening and speaking activities into distinct parts.

## Safe Learning Environments

Ensemble helps to foster a safe learning environment where we can make mistakes together and learn how they can be overcome.  Navigators who give instructions are only in this seat for a brief period until it is passed off.  Together, the group can learn from struggles and mistakes and provide opportunities to teach and understand other perspectives.

## Understanding How We Think

A major benefit of this structure is in building bonds together and understanding how others you are working with think and approach problems.  This helps to build empathy, understanding and alignment in how the group behaves.

## Interesting Techniques

### Calling the shot

When a navigator is making a decision, calling the shot means to clearly state how they think their decision will turn out.  There is no cost to being right or wrong, but working through the decision to guess the result helps to make assumptions based on a model and then see the results.
