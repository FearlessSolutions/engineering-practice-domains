# Context Driven Testing Concepts & Practices

## Understanding context to make the right calls

Part of building software with a soul here is to make sure that when software is tested, we test in a way that really helps to capture the spirit of what we try to do, not just with developing software, but in delivering solutions that meet needs and solve problems.  In our opinion, one of the best approaches to making this happen is to understand the context as a whole during testing, during design, during development in order to make sure we have a good understanding of all the factors and facets of a problem to make the best decisions we can.  With that in mind, we utilize the [Context Driven Testing](https://context-driven-testing.com/) principles to guide our activities and help advocate for the best software we can build.

## Working together, diverse solutions

One of the most important principles we lean on as testers is that only through working together can we build a wider understanding of our context in order make good choices about what to do next.  A variety of perspectives from different roles, backgrounds and personalities is essential to rounding out how we think.  While we may be experienced in testing, our experience cannot make up for new perspectives and ideas that may drive new approaches.  As testers, we welcome second opinions, alternate ideas, different approaches so that we can approach testing as holistically as possible.
