# Core Testing Concepts and Philosophies

## Primary Philosophies

### [Context Driven Testing](https://context-driven-testing.com/)

This is the primary school of thought we go by since it generally encompasses the principles we follow day to day and are the set of principles that help us to approach testing as holistically as possible, even outside of the role of test engineering.  While test engineers might be the primary practitioners, evangelists and champions of this kind of thinking, we encourage others to embrace these philosophies, across all roles.

### [Modern Testing](https://www.moderntesting.org/)

Much like Context Driven Testing, the set of principles behind Modern Testing are major drivers in how we think and are very closely related to the principles in Context Driven Testing.  These tend to take a little bit more of a business minded approach, which is necessary for understanding how testing fits in to consulting, business needs and a service driven marketplace.

### [Testing Manifesto](https://www.growingagile.co.za/2015/04/the-testing-manifesto/)

In the same vein as the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), these principles are wonderful guides that help point us in a good direction for making decisions about how we approach testing and tend to lead towards a more holistic approach and a collaborative working environment.
