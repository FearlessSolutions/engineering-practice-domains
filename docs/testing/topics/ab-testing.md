# A/B Testing Concepts and Practices

## Understanding Users

A/B Testing is a practice that covers the interests of both designers and testers, helping us to answer questions about what good designs might be, how they should change and what our users actually expect.   This gives us the opportunity to see designs, prototypes and real world applications being used by actual users in order to garner realistic feedback for what might need to be different.  This type of experiment provides clear and direct data on how things behave in realistic circumstances.  As a tester, we are advocates for the users of the systems we build, but we often find ourselves unable to truly embrace and understand what our users do.  We are not the users, but we can observe users to find out how we can best support their needs.
